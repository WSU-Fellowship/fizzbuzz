# Getting Started

Let's practice TDD with the classic FizzBuzz problem. The initial application structure is in place to produce 100
FizzBuzz numbers. Your task is to add tests to *FizzbuzzApplicationTests.java* and implement a working solution
in the `nextNumber()` method in *FizzbuzzApplication.java*.

### Requirements
The rules are simple:
* If the current number is divisible by 3, "Fizz" should be printed to the screen
* If the current number is divisible by 5, "Buzz" should be printed to the screen
* If the current number is divisible by both 3 and 5, "FizzBuzz" should be printed to the screen.
